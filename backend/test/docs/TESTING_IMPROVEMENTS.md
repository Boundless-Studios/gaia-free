Observations:

Agents:
1) There's not much to test with _agents_ definition, since it's pretty declarative. 
2) Agent behavior will need to be tested with evaluators, rather than strictly and for this we need a framework
3) Can consider using braintrust or use our own, need to decide on a good framework. 
4) For agents, we should primarily be evaluating guardrails and hook execution
